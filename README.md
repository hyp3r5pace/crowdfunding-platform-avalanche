# Introduction  
In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a decentralized crowdfunding dApp having features namely create project, fund a project, withdraw fund, get refund if funding isn't successful etc. We will build the smart contract in Solidity and the frontend of our application with the help of ReactJS.  

# Prerequisites
