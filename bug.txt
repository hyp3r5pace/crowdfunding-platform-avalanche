1. Dummy pic not displayed in recent upload section of the home page (image render issue??) (check later -- not so important)
2. UI bug for carousel (slider) --> they are not horizontally in the same level
3. The refund logic for contributors in project page is not much optimized (not scalable).
4. The logic for rerender of project component after payment is not very good (very random due to state update and unoptimized).
